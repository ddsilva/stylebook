## Intro

Stylebook is a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) addon.
Stylebook adds endless possibilities and all kind of UI customizations, making [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) more dinamyc as style-guides use-cases, for instance.

> Before we begin, we need to learn a bit about how Storybook works.

Basically, Storybook has a Manager App and a Preview Area.
Manager App is the client side UI for Storybook. Preview Area is the place where the story is rendered. Usually the Preview Area is an iframe.

![Stylebook](./docs/static/sb-basics.png)

With that being said, Storybook doesn't have many options for customizing the Manager app area, such as putting your company logo or styling the search input, as well the list-items for stories itself.
<br /><br />
Stylebooks allows you using a [React component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) as the manager app and customizing it as you wish.<br />
Since this is a early-stage addon project, Stylebook only supoorts [React](https://reactjs.org/) for now, We hope to add support for other frameworks soon.

## Installation

First of all, you need to install knobs into your project as a dev dependency.

```sh
yarn add -D @stylebook/core
```

Then, register it as an addon by adding it to your `addons.js` file (located in the .storybook directory).

```js
import "@stylebook/core/register"
```

## Configuration

Import and add the decorator `withManager` to your `config.js` file (located in the .storybook directory as well).
You' ll need to import the StoriesProvider component too, this is the wrapper components for a custom manager, it'll provide the stories array for you.

```js
import { withManager } from "@stylebook/core/decorators"
import { StoriesProvider } from "@stylebook/core/components"
```

```js
let generateProject = project => {
  let code = []
  for (let js = 0; js < project.length; js++) {
    code.push(js)
  }
}
```

## Usage

You are almost ready to go: with the addon imports now you can create your own manager component wrapped by `StoriesProvider` that will provide the stories for you! The sky is the limit!

```js
//load stories
const req = require.context("../stories", true, /\.stories\.jsx$/)
function loadStories() {
  req.keys().forEach(filename => req(filename))
}

//create a new custom manager
//you can use your own react components or icons - whatever you like
const newManager = (
  <StoriesProvider>
    {stories => (
      <ul>
        {stories.map(story => (
          <li key={story.kind}>
            <span>{story.kind}</span>
            <ul>
              {story.stories.map(substory => (
                <li key={substory.name}>
                  <button onClick={linkTo(story.kind, substory.name)}>
                    {substory.name}
                  </button>
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    )}
  </StoriesProvider>
)

const options = {
  component: newManager
}

//pass the new manager for stylebook addon
addDecorator(withManager(options))
//finish storybook configuration
configure(loadStories, module)
```
